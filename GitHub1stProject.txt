TFS add project by cloning....

This repository is empty
No content was found in the SourceAbled_QA repository. To get started, you need to do one of the following options:
Clone the empty repository
If you are starting on an entirely new project, you can clone the empty repository to your local machine and then work locally before pushing changes back to the server.
From Visual Studio
You can Clone a repository after connecting with Team Explorer.
From the command line
You can clone the project using the following command:
git clone http://assetmanagement.webteamcorp.com:8080/tfs/QualityAssuranceCollection/_git/SourceAbled_QA
After cloning try to push by changing all the files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is very important for already existing project on the TFS repository.
If you want to push whole new project to the existing TFS repository:
First clone the project using the following command:
git clone http://assetmanagement.webteamcorp.com:8080/tfs/QualityAssuranceCollection/_git/SourceAbled_QA
After cloning delete all the files which you received via cloning.
Add all the new files from your local directory to this location where you have cloned this project.
After that use git push command to put all the files to remote TFS repository.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Push an existing repository
If you already have an existing Git repository, you can push it to the server.
From Visual Studio
You can Push a repository after connecting with Team Explorer and adding the Git repo to your list of Local Git Repositories.
From the command line
You can push the project using the following commands:
git remote add origin http://assetmanagement.webteamcorp.com:8080/tfs/QualityAssuranceCollection/_git/SourceAbled_QA
git push -u origin --all
git push origin +master (to push in existing and different repository)
git push --set-upstream origin master

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It turns out that this only started happening after I needed to change Windows logon password.

The password was updated locally and on the TFS server, but not in the cached credentials for git.

Fix
Control Panel -> Credential Manager -> Generic Credentials

Then update the password for git:http://ServerName:1234/

Now I can successfully access the repo from command line and VS Code.
